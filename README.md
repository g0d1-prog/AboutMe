## :dart: About Me ##

Hi! 

My name is Pedro Barros, but I'm known as Barros, I'm 20 years old now, and I live with my mother and my dog ​​who are my family, I really like sports, especially volleyball, where I've played professionally, but at the moment I only practice bodybuilding . 

Some of my hobbies include: Investment in Fixed Income, Gym, Games and Web and Desktop Programming.

 I've always been passionate about technology, because when I was younger I used to play a lot and make many changes within the games I played (called mods), and with that it awoke in me the passion for creation, and, technology, so I discovered the area of ​​programming. My dream and goal currently is to be a Full Stack Web Developer using the tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript and their frameworks to create the Front-end, Django for the Back End architecture, administration of applications on my site and as a database, I want to use SQL language. 

I am a very friendly, dedicated, focused, committed, volatile person and my main characteristic is to learn quickly, I can absorb, store and search information with extreme ease. My secret? Be competent and motivated, following my feeling and goals. 

I hope to learn a lot wherever I join and improve a lot in my field!
